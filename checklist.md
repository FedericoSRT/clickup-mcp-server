# ClickUp MCP Server Testing Checklist

## Overview
This checklist guides the testing of all MCP tools after removing the cache and webhook implementation. Each tool will be tested systematically, with any issues fixed immediately before moving to the next tool.

## Testing Process
1. For each tool, we'll test using both ID-based and name-based approaches (when applicable)
2. If an issue is found, it will be documented, fixed, and retested before proceeding
3. After each tool is tested, this checklist will be updated with the results

## Tools to Test

### Workspace Tools
- [x] get_workspace_hierarchy
  - [x] Test API call: Verify hierarchy structure is correctly returned
  - [x] Verify spaces, folders, and lists are properly represented
  - [x] Check the correct paths and relationships are maintained
  - [x] Issue found: Workspace tool not initialized
    - Problem: The initializeWorkspaceTool function was defined but never called
    - Fix: Updated index.ts to import and call initializeWorkspaceTool with the clickUpServices
    - Status: Fix verified, tool is working correctly
  - Result: Successfully retrieved workspace hierarchy with proper structure
  - Hierarchical structure correctly shows:
    - Team Space (space)
      - Cursor Projects (folder)
        - Multiple lists including clickup-mcp-server
      - MCP Test Folder (folder)
        - MCP Test List and MCP Test List 2

### Task Tools
- [x] create_task
  - [x] Test with list ID
    - Result: Successfully created task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Using ID" in clickup-mcp-server list
    - ID-based task creation works correctly
  - [x] Test with list name
    - Result: Successfully created task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Using Name" using list name lookup
    - Name-based lookup works correctly
  - [x] Test with markdown description
    - Result: Markdown formatting in description works properly
    - Both bold text and list items rendered correctly
  - [x] Test with all optional parameters
    - Result: Successfully created task with priority set to 2 (high)
    - Optional parameters are correctly passed to the API

- [x] get_task
  - [x] Test with task ID
    - Result: Successfully retrieved task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Using ID" by its ID
    - All task details correctly returned
  - [x] Test with task name (and list name)
    - Result: Successfully retrieved task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Using Name" by name and list name
    - Name-based lookup works correctly
    - All task details correctly returned including priority=high
  - [x] Test with non-existent task
    - Result: Proper error handling for non-existent task name
    - Error message correctly states "Task 'Non-existent Task Name' not found"
    - Note: Error handling for invalid task ID returns "Unauthorized: Invalid API key" which should be improved

- [x] update_task
  - [x] Test with task ID
    - Result: Successfully updated task name and description using task ID
    - Task renamed to "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID"
    - Markdown description updated correctly

    - Status successfully changed to "in progress"
  - [x] Test updating name, description, status
    - Result: All fields update correctly
    - Markdown formatting preserved in description updates
  - [x] Test priority handling
    - Issue found: Setting priority to null directly in update_task doesn't work as expected
    - Workaround: Use update_bulk_tasks for setting null priority values
    - Root cause: Type handling in the tool's parameter validation
    - Next step: Fix the type handling in the update_task tool to properly accept null values

- [x] move_task
  - [x] Test with task ID and target list ID
    - Result: Successfully moved task with ID "86a75cbw8" to MCP Test List
    - Task maintains its name and description in new list
    - Note: New task ID is generated (86a75ccqm) as part of the move process
  - [x] Test with task name and target list name
    - Initial result: Error encountered: "Invalid request: Priority invalid"
    - Issue found: moveTask was trying to use string priority values instead of numeric IDs
    - Fix implemented:
      1. Added priority conversion code to extract numeric ID from priority object
      2. Added validation to ensure priority is in valid range (1-4) or null
      3. Also fixed the same issue in duplicateTask method for consistency
    - Status: Fix verified âœ…

## Testing Environment

The following test environment will be used:
- Space: "Team Space" (ID: 90132678315)
- Folder: "Cursor Projects" (ID: 90134333596)
- List: "clickup-mcp-server" (ID: 901307920076)
- Test Task IDs:
  - "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID" (was moved to MCP Test List, new ID: 86a75ccqm)
  - "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via Name" (was moved to MCP Test List, new ID: 86a75cfpd)
  - "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID (Copy)" (in MCP Test List, new ID: 86a75cfum)
  - "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID (Copy) (Copy)" (in MCP Test List, new ID: 86a75cfxa)

## Current Testing Status

Successfully completed testing of move_task and duplicate_task tools. Both now handle task priorities correctly.
Next step: Begin testing the delete_task tool to clean up our test tasks.

### delete_task âœ…
- Successfully deleted test tasks using task IDs:
  1. Task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID (Copy) (Copy)" (ID: 86a75cfxa)
  2. Task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via ID (Copy)" (ID: 86a75cfum)
  3. Task "ðŸ§ª Test Task - Updated via Name" (ID: 86a75cfpd)
- All tasks were properly removed from the "MCP Test List"
- Tool correctly returned task information before deletion
- Deletion operations were confirmed successful

### Current Testing Status
- âœ… move_task issue fixed and verified
- âœ… duplicate_task issue fixed and verified
- âœ… delete_task tested successfully
- Next step: Test task creation with priorities to ensure the priority handling is consistent across all task operations

- [x] Test priority handling
  - [x] Create tasks with different priority levels
    - Created task "ðŸŽ¯ Priority Test - Urgent" with priority 1 (urgent)
    - Created task "ðŸŽ¯ Priority Test - High" with priority 2 (high)
    - Verified priorities were set correctly using get_task
  - [x] Test removing priority
    - Successfully removed priority from task "ðŸŽ¯ Priority Test - No Priority" by setting it to null
    - Used update_bulk_tasks tool as it properly handles null priority values
    - Verified priority was removed using get_task
  - Known Limitation:
    - update_task tool has issues handling null priority values directly
    - Workaround: Use update_bulk_tasks tool instead when setting priority to null
    - Example: 
      ```json
      {
        "tasks": [
          {
            "taskId": "task_id_here",
            "priority": null
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    - Root cause: Parameter validation handling in update_task tool
  - Current testing status:
    - move_task and duplicate_task issues fixed and verified âœ…
    - Priority handling across all task operations working correctly when using appropriate tools âœ…
    - Next step: Clean up test tasks and document any remaining issues 

### Due Date Handling Improvements âœ…
- [x] Enhanced due date parsing functionality
  - [x] Added support for relative time expressions
    - Created new function `getRelativeTimestamp()` to calculate dates relative to current time
    - Enhanced `parseDueDate()` function to support expressions like "2 hours from now"
    - Added support for various time units: hours, days, weeks, and months
  - [x] Fixed issues with displaying due times in ClickUp
    - Added `due_date_time: true` flag when setting due dates
    - Ensured time component shows in ClickUp interface instead of just "Today"
    - Updated all task creation and update functions to use this flag
  - [x] Added human-readable date formatting
    - Created new `formatDueDate()` function to convert timestamps to user-friendly dates
    - Updated all task responses to use human-readable format (e.g., "March 10, 2025, 10:56 PM")
    - Kept raw timestamps available as `due_date_raw` for reference
    - Applied formatting to all task-related tools (get_task, get_tasks, create_task, update_task, etc.)
  - [x] Enhanced regex support for complex date expressions
    - Added support for "tomorrow at 9am" type format
    - Added support for "next week at noon" type format
    - Added support for "X days from now at Y:ZZ pm" type format
  - [x] Testing:
    - Successfully created tasks with due dates like "2 hours from now"
    - Updated tasks with dates like "tomorrow at 9am" and "next week at noon" 
    - Confirmed due dates correctly appear with time in ClickUp
    - Verified that all task responses include human-readable dates
  - Issue Solved:
    - Previous implementation only showed the day (e.g., "Today") without time
    - Raw timestamps were difficult to interpret without conversion
    - Now shows full date and time in human-readable format (e.g., "March 10, 2025, 10:56 PM")
  - Implementation details:
    - Enhanced task.ts to set `due_date_time: true` when due date is present
    - Using `parseDueDate()` instead of `parseInt()` for all due date processing
    - Added new regex patterns to support various relative time expressions
    - Added `formatDueDate()` function to format timestamps in user-friendly way
