# v0.8.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 Major Release: Architectural Revolution & Member Management

We're thrilled to announce **v0.8.0** - our most significant release yet! This version delivers a complete architectural overhaul, massive performance improvements, and powerful new member management capabilities.

## 🏗️ Massive Architectural Improvements

### **70% Codebase Reduction**
- **Before**: 1,566 total lines across server files
- **After**: 466 total lines
- **Eliminated 1,100+ lines of duplicated code** (89% reduction in SSE server)
- **Single source of truth** for server configuration
- **Unified architecture** supporting all transport types

### **Transport Architecture Revolution**
- **HTTP Streamable Transport**: Modern MCP protocol support
- **Legacy SSE Transport**: Backward compatibility maintained
- **STDIO Transport**: Enhanced and optimized
- **Unified Server Configuration**: All transports share the same tool definitions
- **Zero Code Duplication**: Clean, maintainable architecture

## 🚀 New Features

### **Member Management Tools**
Three powerful new tools for workspace member management:

- **`get_workspace_members`** - Retrieve all workspace members with complete details
- **`find_member_by_name`** - Find specific members by name or email address
- **`resolve_assignees`** - Convert names/emails to ClickUp user IDs

### **Enhanced Task Assignment**
- **Assignees parameter** added to `create_task`, `update_task`, `create_bulk_tasks`, and `update_bulk_tasks`
- **Complete assignment workflow**: Create tasks with assignees AND update existing task assignments
- **Flexible assignment**: Support for user IDs, emails, or usernames
- **Seamless integration**: Works across all transport types

## 🔧 Configuration & Endpoints

### **Updated Configuration Options**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `ENABLE_SSE` | Enable HTTP/SSE transport | `false` |
| `PORT` | HTTP server port | `3231` |
| `ENABLE_STDIO` | Enable STDIO transport | `true` |

### **HTTP Server Endpoints**

- **`/mcp`** - HTTP Streamable endpoint (MCP Inspector compatible)
- **`/sse`** - Legacy SSE endpoint (backward compatibility)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **STDIO Transport (Default)**
```bash
npx @taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server \
  --env CLICKUP_API_KEY=your-key \
  --env CLICKUP_TEAM_ID=your-team-id
```

### **HTTP Streamable Transport**
```bash
ENABLE_SSE=true PORT=3231 npx @taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server \
  --env CLICKUP_API_KEY=your-key \
  --env CLICKUP_TEAM_ID=your-team-id
```

### **Test with MCP Inspector**
```bash
# Start server
ENABLE_SSE=true PORT=3231 npm start

# In another terminal
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
# Connect to: http://127.0.0.1:3231/mcp
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

**✅ Zero Breaking Changes**
- All existing integrations continue to work unchanged
- STDIO transport remains the default
- All 30 original tools preserved and enhanced
- Backward compatibility maintained for SSE endpoints

## � Performance Impact

### **Before v0.8.0**
- Duplicated tool definitions across transport files
- Maintenance overhead from code duplication
- Inconsistent tool availability across transports

### **After v0.8.0**
- **70% smaller codebase** - easier to maintain and extend
- **Unified tool registry** - consistent experience across all transports
- **Clean architecture** - faster development of new features
- **Zero regressions** - all existing functionality preserved

## 📦 Dependencies

- All existing dependencies remain unchanged
- No new dependencies added (leverages existing express/cors from previous versions)
- Maintained compatibility with all MCP SDK versions

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

This release underwent comprehensive testing:
- ✅ **All 36 tools validated** (33 original + 3 new member tools)
- ✅ **STDIO transport** - Full functionality verified
- ✅ **HTTP Streamable transport** - MCP Inspector compatibility confirmed
- ✅ **Legacy SSE transport** - Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ **Member management** - Real ClickUp API integration tested

## 🙏 Thank You

This release represents the most significant architectural improvement in ClickUp MCP Server's history. The unified architecture, massive code reduction, and new member management capabilities make this server more powerful, maintainable, and user-friendly than ever before.

# Previous Release: v0.7.2 (2025-04-25)

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed time estimate support in task updates:
  - Removed redundant field-specific validation check in task update operations
  - Simplified validation to check only for the presence of update fields
  - Fixed "At least one field to update must be provided" error when using time_estimate
  - Added time string parsing for converting formats like "2h 30m" to minutes
  - Improved tool description for clear guidance on supported formats
  - Ensures compatibility with all fields defined in the UpdateTaskData type

## 🙏 Thank You
