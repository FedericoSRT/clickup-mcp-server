# Changelog

## v0.6.7 (2025-04-03)

### 🚀 New Features & Improvements
- Enhanced token limit protection for workspace tasks:
  - Added handler-level token limit validation (50,000 tokens)
  - Implemented smart response format switching
  - Automatic fallback to summary format for large responses
  - Improved token estimation for task responses
  - Added logging for format switching events
  - Double-layer protection at both service and handler levels

### 🔄 Repository Updates
- Updated task handler implementation with token limit checks
- Added token estimation utilities for task responses

## v0.6.6 (2025-04-03)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed task caching issue causing rate limits:
  - Task IDs from name lookups weren't being shared between sequential operations
  - Each tool operation was performing redundant global task searches
  - Added task name-to-ID mapping in cache to prevent duplicate lookups
  - Improved caching efficiency for sequential operations on same task

## v0.6.5 (2025-03-28)

- Added start date support for tasks:
  - Set task start dates with natural language expressions (e.g., "now", "tomorrow at 9am")
  - Support for both creation and updates via `startDate` parameter
  - Proper time handling with `start_date_time` flag
- Added Global Task Lookup feature:
  - Find tasks by name across the entire workspace without specifying a list
  - Smart disambiguation when multiple tasks share the same name
  - Context-aware results showing list, folder, and space for each match
  - Default selection of most recently updated task when multiple matches exist
  - Backward compatible with list-specific lookups
  - Applied to all task operations: get_task, update_task, delete_task, etc.
  - Improved error messages with actionable information for disambiguation

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations
- Implemented parallel request optimization for task operations:
  - Parallel validation of tasks and lists in move operations
  - Concurrent processing of task and list data
- Added task validation caching:
  - 5-minute TTL cache for task and list validations
  - Reduced redundant API calls in bulk operations
  - Optimized cache updates after successful operations
- Enhanced workspace hierarchy fetching:
  - Implemented batched space processing (3 spaces at a time)
  - Added batched folder processing (5 folders at a time)
  - Improved rate limit compliance with controlled concurrency
  - Added detailed performance logging and metrics

## v0.6.2 (2025-03-27)

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
- Fixed binary execution issue by adding proper shebang line to the main executable

### 🚀 New Features & Improvements
- Added tag support with tools for:
  - Managing tags at the space level (get, create, update, delete)
  - Adding/removing tags from tasks
  - Support for tags when creating and updating tasks
- Enhanced bulk task creation with tags support
- Added natural language color processing for tags:
  - Create tags with color names (e.g., "blue", "red", "yellow")
  - Support for color variations (e.g., "dark blue", "light green")
  - Automatic generation of contrasting foreground colors
  - Color commands in both tag creation and updates
- Added `get_workspace_tasks` tool for retrieving filtered workspace tasks by various criteria:
  - Requires at least one filter parameter (tags, list_ids, space_ids, etc.)
  - Supports filtering by tags, due dates, status, and more
  - Includes pagination and sorting options
  - Implements Adaptive Response Format with two detail levels:
    - `summary`: Lightweight response with essential task information
    - `detailed`: Complete task information with all fields (default)
  - Automatic format selection based on response size (50,000 token threshold)
  - Optimized for handling large datasets efficiently


### 🔄 Repository Updates
- Updated documentation to reflect new tool requirements and capabilities
- Improved API reference with detailed examples and response formats
